(The only ascii art not drawn my me; thank you, patorjk.com)

This Command-Line Interface program aims to aid students in constructing and understanding behaviors of different applications of operational amplifier within the context of ELEC2101.

The program features 3 features:
1. Schmitt Trigger Designer
- Calculate the required component to achieved the desire noise margin from hysteresis.
2. Schmitt Trigger Output Preview
- Read any input signal time-series and preview the output signal of the designed Schmitt Trigger, helping students understand the purpose and effect of positive feedback on nominal Threshold.
3. Sallen-Key Designer
- Calculate the required component when designing active filters using Sallen-Key Designer.
- Works with low-pass, high-pass band; Butterworth, and Chebyshev characteristics.

The program comes with ascii-art personally drawn by me ("art" is clearly an overstatement.) This should further deeper users' understanding in different topologies and avoid confusion when using the program as components calculator.
